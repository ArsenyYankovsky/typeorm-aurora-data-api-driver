### Description

This project is a bridge between [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) and [Aurora Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html). It allows you to migrate to Aurora Data API which is extremely useful is serverless environments by only modifying the connection configuration. 

‚úî Supports both Postgres and MySQL.

‚úî Supports casting (allows using UUID, enums, properly formats date and time columns).

‚ö† Data API currently destroys any timezone information returning everything in UTC. Be aware of that when using Postgres 'timestamp with time zone', 'time with time zone' and similar types.

### How to use

- [Enable the Data API on your database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html)
- Install the driver by running either
```bash
yarn add typeorm-aurora-data-api-driver
```
or
```bash
npm i --save typeorm-aurora-data-api-driver
````

- Modify your connection configuration to look similar to this:

```js
    const connection = await createConnection({
      type: 'aurora-mysql',
      database: 'test-db',
      secretArn: 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:537011205135:secret:xxxxxx/xxxxxx/xxxxxx',
      resourceArn: 'arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:xxxxx:xxxxxx:xxxxxx',
      region: 'eu-west-1',
      serviceConfigOptions: {
        // additional options to pass to the aws-sdk RDS client
      },
      formatOptions: {
        // additional format options to pass to the Data API client
      }
    })
```

Or if you're using Postgres:


```js
    const connection = await createConnection({
      type: 'aurora-postgres',
      database: 'test-db',
      secretArn: 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:537011205135:secret:xxxxxx/xxxxxx/xxxxxx',
      resourceArn: 'arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:xxxxx:xxxxxx:xxxxxx',
      region: 'eu-west-1',
      serviceConfigOptions: {
        // additional options to pass to the aws-sdk RDS client
      },
      formatOptions: {
        // additional format options to pass to the Data API client
      }
    })
```

After you done that you can use the connection just as you did with any other connection:

```js
  const postRepository = connection.getRepository(Post)

  const post = new Post()

  post.title = 'My First Post'
  post.text = 'Post Text'
  post.likesCount = 4

  const insertResult = await postRepository.save(post)
```


### Additional configuration options

This driver uses the [Data API Client](https://github.com/jeremydaly/data-api-client). To pass additional options to it, use `serviceConfigOptions` and `formatOptions` properties.

#### Automatic Casting

By default, this driver will try to cast entity fields on insert and update queries using entity metadata and [Data API client's type casting](https://github.com/jeremydaly/data-api-client#type-casting).
This allows using UUID and enum columns which wouldn't be possible before. To disable this behavior, set the `formatOptions.castParameters` to false.

#### Parameter Casting

You can specify casting for query parameters as well. To do that pass an object with properties `value` and `cast`

```js
const dbPost = await postRepository.findOne({
  title: {
    value: 'f01bdc12-ed72-4260-86aa-b7123f08cab9',
    cast: 'uuid',
  },
})
```

Alternative way of automatically cast your UUID ids is to enable automatic casting of UUID (based on regex) by passing `enableUuidHack: true` to `formatOptions`.

## Developing This Driver

If you want to fix a bug or add a feature for this driver, this section will help you get started.
Let's start with a simple case where you don't need to touch any code in the TypeORM itself.

### Prerequisites

- node.js
- docker
- docker-compose

### Developing Against a Released TypeORM version

#### Initial Setup

1. Fork this repository on GitHub and check out your fork 
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Install TypeORM by running `npm i --no-save typeorm`. You can also install a specific version of the ORM.
4. Run `yarn build` to build the code of the driver itself. You will also need to run this command when you make changes in the files under `/src` directory.

After that, you can run tests to validate your setup.

#### Running Tests

1. Start a docker image with a database

For Postgres:
  
```shell
docker-compose -f docker/pg.yml up -d
```

For MySQL:
  
```shell
docker-compose -f docker/mysql.yml up -d
```

2. Run Functional Tests

For Postgres:

```shell
yarn test:pg-func
```

For MySQL

```shell
yarn test:mysql-func
```

#### Adding a Feature / Fixing a Bug

Once you verified that your setup is correct by running tests, it's time to actually make changes you'd like.
A perfect start would be writing a test for your scenario. 

### Developing against a local TypeORM Version

Some features like adding a connection option would require making changes in both TypeORM 
and this driver.

To develop against a local TypeORM repository, you'll need to replace 
the third step from the initial setup section with the following:

1. In the driver directory, run `yarn link`
2. Fork the TypeORM repository and check out your fork
3. In the TypeORM directory, run `npm i` to install TypeORM dependencies
4. In the TypeORM directory, run `npm run package` to build TypeORM package
5. Under the `build/package` directory in the TypeORM project, run the following command to make sure the TypeORM is not linked: `yarn unlink`
6. Under the `build/package` directory in the TypeORM project, run two following commands: `yarn link` and `yarn link typeorm-aurora-data-api-driver`
7. In the driver directory, run `yarn link typeorm`

What this will do is create symlinks where the driver will use a locally built TypeORM package and a locally built TypeORM package will use a locally built driver.

```
<driver repo directory>/node_modules/typeorm -> <typeorm repo directory>/build/package
<typeorm repo directory>/build/package/node_modules/typeorm-aurora-data-api-driver -> <driver repo directory>
```

Unfortunately, every time you need to make a change in the TypeORM directory you'll need to rerun steps 
4-7 which is very slow. Please submit a PR updating this readme if you find a nicer way of doing it.
